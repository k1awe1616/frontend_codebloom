            <h2>Levels and Progression</h2>
            <p>
                Our platform is designed to help you master programming concepts through a series of levels.
                Each level focuses on a specific programming language and a unique challenge.
                You must complete the current level to unlock the next one.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to the **"Play"** section from the main menu.</li>
                <li>Select the language and level you wish to attempt.</li>
                <li>Read the problem description carefully and write your code in the provided editor.</li>
                <li>Run your code to check for errors and to see if it passes the tests.</li>

            <h2>Practice Debugging</h2>
            <p>
                Debugging is a core skill for any developer. The **"Practice Debugging"** section provides you with real-world scenarios where you must find and fix bugs in pre-written code.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The code will have one or more bugs that you must identify.</li>
                <li>The editor will highlight potential areas of interest, but the solution is up to you.</li>
                <li>Test your code after each fix to see if you have resolved the issue.</li>
                <li>There is no time limit, so take your time and learn from the experience.</li>
            </ul>
